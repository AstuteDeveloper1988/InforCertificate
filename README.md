Infor Certificate Generator V1.0 is a web-based application designed to generate training certificates for staff members at Astute. This solution helps monitor and track employee progress while identifying any outstanding training requirements. The primary goal of the system is to establish a comprehensive training matrix for all departments across the business. In its current version (V1.0), the system generates a certificate once a trainer completes and submits the form. The certificate can then be saved and uploaded to Atlas. Certificate Generator V2.0 will introduce a live training progress overview, allowing trainers to review employee progress in real time. Additionally, trainers will have the ability to set review dates and schedule training sessions, further enhancing the systemâ€™s functionality.
